# Safety-and-Services-in-Institutes
# Design Thinking Project
# NPTEL - IIT KANPUR Program

# Project Overview
This project aims to identify, analyze, and propose innovative solutions to enhance safety and services within educational institutes. Using the Design Thinking approach, the project focuses on understanding user needs (students, staff, and visitors), identifying pain points, and ideating user-centered improvements for a safer and more supportive institutional environment.

# Problem Statement
Educational institutes often face challenges related to:
Physical safety and security of campus members
Accessibility and quality of essential services (healthcare, counseling, transportation)
Emergency preparedness and response
Communication and awareness about safety protocols
Our goal is to design effective and practical solutions that address these issues comprehensively.

# Objectives
To empathize with stakeholders by gathering insights and experiences related to safety and service issues.
To define core problems that affect well-being and productivity.
To ideate and prototype solutions leveraging technology, process improvements, and policy changes.
To test and refine solutions with user feedback to ensure effectiveness and usability.

# Design Thinking Process
Phase	Activities	Outcome
